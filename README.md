Lost in a village

Trying to get home

They got to the village by time travelling

They don't know that they time travelled

They are in the past

To get home they need a time machine

They have to fix it

It's missing some pieces

They find out they're in the past by looking at a newspaper

They find parts under seats in the bus they ride in, underneath the bus, around town, etc.
